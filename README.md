# ASP_Warhammer
This repository is dedicated to an ASP.NET web application built on top of an MVC architecture.


Utilized Microsoft ASP.Net MVC patterns to create a dynamic web application that performs HTTP Post method to interact with a SQL Server database.
Utilized a combination of HTML and C# to provide structure to the web page and data from C# to populate records in a tabular format.
Bootstrapped with CSS to apply design patterns to the web application to provide a visually appealing look.
